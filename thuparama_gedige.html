		At the southern end of the Quadrangle, the Thuparama Gedige is the smallest gedige (hollow Buddhist temple with thick walls) in Polonnaruwa, but is also one of the best: it's the only one with its roof intact, supported by corbel arch-style supports. The inner chamber is delightfully cool and contains eight beautifully executed Buddha statues.

		The building shows a strong Hindu influence and is thought to date from the reign of Parakramabahu I.

		The reign of King Parakramabahu-1 is considered as the “glories chapter” in the Sri Lankan history. Once the entire island was under one banner King Parakramabahu 1 devoted his time to restoration of irrigational work. He made a 2500 hectare tank called ‘Parakrama Samudra’ (‘Sea of Parakrama’) the city and the surrounding area were watered by the irrigational complex using the tank. The massive buildings, parks, shrines and sacred places made the city more beautiful palace. At the end of his reign in 1186 A.D the whole irrigation system of the dry zone was working to full capacity.
		North of Pothgul Vihara there is a 11.5 feet high granite statue. This is believed to be a rock sculpture of King Parakaramabahu -I but even still the stature is matter of debate whether it is Agastaya or King Parakramabahu I
